# Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Models
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system for predicting diseases based on user-provided symptoms. By analyzing input symptoms, the system predicts the most probable disease using trained models, aiding early detection and facilitating timely intervention.
Features

    User-friendly interface for symptom input and disease prediction.
    Trained models to accurately predict diseases based on provided symptoms.
    Support for multiple diseases with a robust and scalable architecture.
    Integration of advanced machine learning algorithms for improved prediction accuracy.

Technology Stack

    Programming Language: Python
    Machine Learning Algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.
    Libraries:
        pandas: For data manipulation
        numpy: For numerical computations
        scikit-learn: For model training and evaluation
        flask: For web-based interface development

Dataset

The project uses a publicly available dataset containing symptoms and corresponding diseases. The dataset includes features representing symptoms and target labels representing diseases. The data is preprocessed for consistency and quality before training the models.
Installation
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8 or higher
    pip (Python package manager)

Steps

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Disease-prediction-using-Machine-Learning.git  
cd Disease-prediction-using-Machine-Learning  

Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt  

Run the application:

    python app.py  

Usage

    Open the application in your web browser (default: http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
    Enter symptoms in the provided fields.
    Submit the form to get a disease prediction along with the model's confidence score.

Machine Learning Workflow

    Data Preprocessing:
        Handling missing values and duplicates.
        Encoding categorical variables.

    Model Training:
        Training various machine learning algorithms.
        Tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

    Model Evaluation:
        Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate performance.
        Selecting the best-performing model for deployment.

Future Enhancements

    Integration of deep learning models for more complex predictions.
    Expansion of the symptom database to include rare diseases.
    Mobile app development for ease of access.
